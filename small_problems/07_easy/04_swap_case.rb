# Swap Case
# Write a method that takes a string as an argument 
# and returns a new string in which every uppercase letter is replaced by its lowercase version, 
# and every lowercase letter by its uppercase version. 
# All other characters should be unchanged.

# You may not use String#swapcase; write your own version of this method.



# Example:

def swapcase(string)
  string.chars.map do |char|
    if char == char.upcase
      char.downcase
    else
      char.upcase
    end
  end.join("")
end
  
p swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
p swapcase('Tonight on XYZ-TV') == 'tONIGHT ON xyz-tv'
