 Summary
 In this assignment we've looked at sorting as another way we can work with collections. 

 A few important points to remember:

 * Sorting is complex to carry out algorithmically on your own, but we can use the built-in sort and sort_by methods to do the complex work for us.
 * Comparison is at the heart of sorting. When sorting collections, you need to know if the objects you want to sort on implement a <=> method and how that method is defined.
 * Methods other than sort and sort_by also use comparison as the basis for how they work.

At this point you should understand the concept of sorting and be comfortable using the sort and sort_by methods.
